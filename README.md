### Description
This is an image viewer based on Qt and OpenGL. I do it for fun :)

### TODO
* ~~Camera-based zoom in/out using scrolling.~~
* ~~Move image around using mouse drag.~~ Need a more accurate formula.
* Render an image as 3D object(i.e. add a little thickness in Z-direction).
* Open an image from file manager. (use argv in main?)  
* Use grid view to display images in the selected folder.
