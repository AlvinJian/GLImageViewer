### Description
This is an image viewer based on Qt and OpenGL. I do it for fun :)

### TODO
* ~~Camera-based zoom in/out using scrolling.~~
* Move image around using mouse drag.
* Render image as 3D(i.e. add a little thickness in Z-direction).
* Use grid view to display images in the selected folder.
